                <p>Hello! My name is Zach Draper, I am 33 years old. I have 2 kids, an 11 year old daughter and a 4 year
                    old son. They are my life, everything that i do in my life now is for them, including finding a better way to make money
                    to support them.

                    I am currently in the University of Utah Coding bootcamp, and am extremely excited to go on this
                    journey. I already have a little background in the industry, I recieved an assosiates degree in
                    computer programming from Eagle Gate College. Although that was 10 years ago, and i never kept coding or looking for a job. I
                    regret it now, and am ready to get back into, and stick with it this time.

                    A few things that i enjoy doing for fun spending time with my kids is the most imoportant thing to
                    me. I also enjoy spending time with my friends. I enjoy anything to do with being outside, wether it is fishing, hiking,
                    camping, or writing code. I really enjoy the challenges to building websites, and see a bright future in the
                    industry.
