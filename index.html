                    <p>Hello! My name is Zach Draper, I am 33 years old. I have 2 kids, an 11 year old daughter and a 4 year old son. They are my life, everything that i do in my life now is for them, including finding a better way to make money to support
                        them. I am currently in the University of Utah Coding bootcamp, and am extremely excited to go on this journey. I already have a little background in the industry, I recieved an assosiates degree in computer programming from Eagle
                        Gate College. Although that was 10 years ago, and i never kept coding or looking for a job. I regret it now, and am ready to get back into, and stick with it this time. A few things that i enjoy doing for fun spending time with
                        my kids is the most imoportant thing to me. I also enjoy spending time with my friends. I enjoy anything to do with being outside, wether it is fishing, hiking, camping, or writing code. I really enjoy the challenges to building
                        websites, and see a bright future in the industry.
